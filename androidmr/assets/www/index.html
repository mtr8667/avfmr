	        		<h2>week one: discussion, project intent</h2>
	        		<h4>1. How could Twitter be used with login and payment live data resources?</h4>
			  
		<p><small>Twitter actually has a sign in with Twitter feature that can be implemented if a user has access to a browser or a web-connected mobile device. Due to the popularity of Twitter and its recognizable brand any website or mobile web app could integrate the sign in with Twitter functionality to allow their users to very easily register on their websites or mobile apps. Similarly your Twitter account information could be used to purchase items/products as proposed by paycento. Please see the reference links below.</small></p> 
		<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/sign-twitter/"><span>twitter reference</span></a></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/02/paycento-facebook-twitter-online-payment_n_1396678.html/"><span>paycento reference</span></a></p>
		
		<h4>2. Why JSON-P?</h4>
		<p><small> JSON-P (JSON with Padding) let's us get around the same origin policy providing cross-domain access to an existing JSON API, by wrapping a JSON payload (object) in a function call. Please see reference link below.</small></p>
		
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP/"><span>wikipedia JSONP</span></a></p>     
		
		
		
		<h4>3. Which JSON-P data resources might pair well with the various native features.</h4>
		<p><small>My current AVF project concept is to aggregate, organize and summarize responsive design practices and techniques. Initially mashing the native feature of connection and device with customizing content and paving the way to access data APIs relative to responsive design would be obvious first choices.  While obvious and probably the most simple implementations of native features connection and device appear to be a great place to start and very valuable for any app. Utilizing various social networks like twitter and Facebook along with youtube APIs would also be great places to start pulling in relevant chatter, information, videos and current posts on responsive design.  This information could then be mashed in any number of ways.  Articles of interest could access the storage native feature to save favorites.  These favorites could also be stored temporally while the local contact database is accessed facilitating emailing an important piece of aggregated responsive news to a friend or client.  Finally you could use the notification native feature with the data that you have pulled to notify friends, users ,clients etc.. that a specific piece of news has arrived.

		</small></p>
		  
		<h4>4. Please describe design and functionality intentions for your AVF demo app.</h4>
		<p><small>Similar to the mashup ideas I stated in my answer to question 3 I would like to integrate Twitter feeds searched by responsive design keywords (fluid text, fluid design , fluid grids etc...) into a stored list that can be referenced, shared and appended to.  I would also like to integrate relevant responsive news into the app via the storage and alert native features.  With regard to design I want to fully implement a responsive design that will automatically respond to mobile, tablet and desktop contextual environments.  I‚Äôll prioritize the content by viewport and gradually move from two columns with a header and footer to one column on a mobile device.  Content will also be prioritized re-ordered and re-organized based on viewport and contextual relevance. . I will also try to keep usability in mind utilizing alerts as well as integration with social media even if its just links when appropriate in the app.
</small></p>     
		
		<h4>5. Briefly describe some past lessons learned.</h4>
		<p><small>Planning and organization is key with regard to development!  There are so many different components and parts to building a mobile app that anything less than a concentrated effort in these two areas could result in failure, leaving something out, missing a requirement or not being able to actually build the application.  So, while its a work in progress, I'm trying to develop a methodology/procedure to follow when developing a mobile app.  This includes breaking the project down by requirements and this means for Full Sail classes looking at all the weeks requirements in the beginning so you can see the big picture and plan accordingly.  I have also been trying to break things down by technology, framework, programming language etc. in order to help keep things in the in the right department so to speak.  This also helps with trouble shooting. This time around I have used moqups.com and mindjet.com to assist me. Time management is also key getting hung up on a bug with an open source install is common place if you don't divide your work accordingly and get hung up on a bug too long you very well might run out of time. Lastly I'm learning to immediately go to the web when I believe I'm in bug land to attempt to research a solution in an effort to save the most precious of all commodities time.</small></p>

	        		<h2>week two: discussion, accessibility</h2>
	        		<h4>1. What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML in your Demo App to be more accessible?</h4>
			  
		<p><small>Don‚Äôt include Flash for starters or strip it out, screen readers have a problem with Flash video. Use HTML5 video for native controls, captions, descriptions, audio descriptions and sign language video. Make sure that all images and video have good descriptions associated with them by utilizing the ‚Äúalt‚Äù attribute, most browsers will display or read this attribute if there is a problem displaying the image.  Make sure that your fonts are resizable/relative thus allowing the viewer to change the font size through the browser.  Also use semantic HTML tags. These tags are much more descriptive than div tags so when screen readers read your semantic HMTL much more information and understanding is relayed. You could also take advantage of HTML5‚Äôs markup for captioning (webVTT), descriptions and subtitles when using video. Finally keep the presentation and functionality layers separate.
</small></p> 
				
		<h4>2. Visit a video service on the web and search for ‚ÄúScreen Reader Demo‚Äù and ‚ÄúMobile Screen Reader‚Äù. What are some of the common frustrations that you see among the examples given? How could you fix and or use them?
</h4>
		<p><small> Generally the current price point of screen readers excludes and estimated 85% of the market, they‚Äôre expensive. Blind people can‚Äôt see the cursor and have to memorize keyboard commands. Traditional browsers aren‚Äôt much use to blind people due to the webpage being populated with images and graphics that are of no use to blind people so text browsers should be used to increase efficiency. Some of the other top frustrations of screen reader users are the page layout of the site causing confusion, poorly designed forms, misleading links, inaccessible PDFs or files, and screen reader crashes. Obviously designing a web environment keeping accessibility in mind is a good first step in easing these frustrations. By using semantic HTML websites through descriptive tag names can effectively convey a sites layout reducing confusion. Also using software to cleanup and check your code and assist in reducing frustrations by identifying missing ‚Äúalt‚Äù attributes broken links and other problems with your websites code. 
</small></p>
		
		 
		
		
		
		<h4>3. List two devices and some of the features that are made specifically to support accessibility.
</h4>
		<p><small>Well I never looked at it this way before but SIRI the Apple iOS assistant is obviously a device made specifically to support accessibility. Just by pressing a button you can bring up the SIRI assistant ( there is an audible beep when SIRI is ready. You can then speak your request and SIRI will search its database for an answer for you.  If no answer is found you are prompted with an option to continue your search on the web. No typing is generally necessary when using SIRI so not only does this help the blind but also the physically impaired.  For my second device I would like to use the iPhone itself specifically the touch based interface. As stated above one of the main frustrations with impaired users using screen readers is the fact that they have to memorize the hot keys and quick key in order to work with the screen reading software to navigate around the webpage.  Having a touch based interface can remove much of this frustration by letting simple finger gestures take the place of sophisticated key commands.


		</small></p>
		  
		<h4>4. List two apps that are made specifically to support accessibility.</h4>
		<p><small>Talking Calculator by Adam Croser has full voice over support and the option for users to use speech for answers, button names and formulas. As you move your finger over the screen the names of buttons are spoken to you. In addition the app is customizable for different levels of vision. Normal to low vision would have large, clear buttons with optional speech while low vision has high contrast display mode with optional speech etc.

Digit-Eyes QR Code/Barcode Reader Labeler by Digital Miracles, LLC allows users to scan UPC / EAN codes a hear the names of over 34 million products. In addition the app/ site allows user to download there own QR codes to place on and label whatever they want with a voice recording. So a blind user could label items in the fridge or panty etc. When the item is scanned it reads the users recording describing the item. 

The website that I used for much of this information literally had hundreds of these accessibility apps broken out into 20 or so categories. Pretty impressive to know that all this exists out there.
