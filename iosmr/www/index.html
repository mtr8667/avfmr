	        		<h2>week one: Data Research, Project Intent</h2>
	        		<h4>1. How could Twitter be used with login and payment live data resources?</h4>
			  
		<p><small>Twitter actually has a sign in with Twitter feature that can be implemented if a user has access to a browser or a web-connected mobile device. Due to the popularity of Twitter and its recognizable brand any website or mobile web app could integrate the sign in with Twitter functionality to allow their users to very easily register on their websites or mobile apps. Similarly your Twitter account information could be used to purchase items/products as proposed by paycento. Please see the reference links below.</small></p> 
		<p><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/sign-twitter/"><span>twitter reference</span></a></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/02/paycento-facebook-twitter-online-payment_n_1396678.html/"><span>paycento reference</span></a></p>
		
		<h4>2. Why JSON-P?</h4>
		<p><small> JSON-P (JSON with Padding) let's us get around the same origin policy providing cross-domain access to an existing JSON API, by wrapping a JSON payload (object) in a function call. Please see reference link below.</small></p>
		
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP/"><span>wikipedia JSONP</span></a></p>     
		
		
		
		<h4>3. Which JSON-P data resources might pair well with the various native features.</h4>
		<p><small>My current AVF project is centered around finance, investing, saving keeping track of your budget etc. so my responses will take this into consideration. Mashing the storage native feature to a daily news feed from USA Today's money section could allow the user to save links of interests to articles provided by the news feed.  You could similarly mash a twitter search on tweets that mention buy recommendations on various securities with the storage native feature allowing you to compile a list of buy recommended stocks. This list could then in turn be retrieved from storage and with the help on the contact native featured quickly emailed to a friend.  You could pull data from a resources that track the global markets daily results and futures and pair it with the natives features of alert and globalization to display the results and futures of select markets around the world. Additionally you could pull live housing data (if you were interested in buying a house a very large investment ) after you searched on your current location using the native geolocation feature to get the results. This information could direct you to a potential home and allow you to take pictures with the native camera feature to then archive using the storage native feature or send to your wife. :)
		</small></p>
		  
		<h4>4. Please describe design and functionality intentions for your AVF demo app.</h4>
		<p><small>Similar to the mashup ideas I stated in my answer to question 3 I would like to integrate Twitter feeds searched by buy recommendations into a stored list that can be referenced, shared and appended to.  I would also like to integrate relevant financial news into the app via the storage and alert native features.  With regard to design I want to continue with the infinite drop down approach started with what I handed in with my AVF demo launch page but implement responsive design so when accessed on an iPad or tablet supporting content would be displayed to the right of the nav content. The launch page on the tablet would also default to one of the nav selections being opened immediately if the app was opened on a iPad or tablet. This was not reflected in the initial AVF demo launch page because I focused on the nav only in the first week and semantic HTML to set this up. I will also try to keep usability in mind utilizing alerts as well as integration with social media even if its just links when appropriate in the app.</small></p>     
		
		<h4>5. Briefly describe some past lessons learned.</h4>
		<p><small>Planning & organization is key with regard to development!  There are so many different components and parts to building a mobile app that anything less than a concentrated effort in these two areas could result in failure, leaving something out, missing a requirement or not being able to actually build the application.  So, while its a work in progress, I'm trying to develop a methodology/procedure to follow when developing a mobile app.  This includes breaking the project down by requirements and this means for Full Sail classes looking at all the weeks requirements in the beginning so you can see the big picture and plan accordingly.  I have also been trying to break things down by technology, framework, programming language etc. in order to help keep things in the in the right department so to speak.  This also helps with trouble shooting. Time management is also key getting hung up on a bug with an open source install is common place if you don't divide your work accordingly and get hung up on a bug too long you very well might run out of time. Lastly I'm learning to immediately go to the web when I believe I'm in bug land to attempt to research a solution in an effort to save the most precious of all commodities time.</small></p>
